# ðŸ§¬ shotgun metagenomics Taxonomy Visualization 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Taxonomy_barplot.ipynb`) for visualizing the relative abundance of microbial taxa from metagenomic or amplicon sequencing data. The visualization focuses on generating **taxonomy barplots** to compare microbial community compositions across different samples.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Reads taxonomy abundance data from a file (e.g., CSV/TSV).
- Processes and aggregates taxonomic levels (e.g., Phylum, Genus).
- Generates high-quality barplots using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.
- Supports grouping and coloring by sample metadata.
